# 🐍 Python Fundamentals Journey

A comprehensive collection of Python projects demonstrating core programming concepts and practical applications. This repository showcases my progression from basic syntax to building functional applications with classes, file handling, and external libraries.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains 23 hands-on Python projects completed as part of my full-stack development certification. Each project folder represents a focused learning module that builds upon previous concepts, culminating in fully functional applications like personal assistants, language translators, and interactive games.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

### Core Python Concepts
- **Variables & Data Types** - Working with strings, integers, floats, and booleans
- **Data Structures** - Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- **Control Flow** - Conditional statements and loops (for, while)
- **Functions** - Creating reusable code blocks with parameters and return values

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes & Objects** - Designing custom classes with attributes and methods
- **Encapsulation** - Organizing code into logical, maintainable structures
- **Practical Applications** - Pet shop management, personal assistant systems

### Advanced Topics
- **File I/O** - Reading from and writing to files for data persistence
- **Error Handling** - Implementing try-except blocks for robust applications
- **External Libraries** - Working with modules like turtle graphics, datetime
- **API Integration** - Building a language translator with external services

- Geometric pattern generation
- Event-driven programming
- Coordinate system manipulation

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `main.py` - The primary project file with implementation
- `solution.py` - Reference solution (where applicable)
- Supporting files - Data files, configurations as needed

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system
- Basic understanding of command line navigation

### Running the Projects

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd project-folder-name
python3 main.py
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
cd project-folder-name
python main.py
```

### Installing Dependencies
Most projects use Python's standard library. For projects requiring external packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

The projects are organized to build knowledge progressively:

1. **Foundation** (Variables, Math, Data Types)
   - `build-your-first-variable`
   - `math-can-be-fun-with-python`

2. **Data Structures** (Lists, Dictionaries)
   - `clean-up-this-list`
   - `updating-this-list`
   - `create-a-contacts-list-dictionary`

3. **Control Flow** (Loops, Conditionals)
   - `iterate-through-numbers`
   - `design-a-guessing-game`

4. **Functions** (Modular Code)
   - `build-an-hours-worked-function`

5. **OOP** (Classes, Objects)
   - `build-a-pet-shop-with-a-python-class`
   - `start-your-personal-assitant-class`

6. **File I/O & Persistence**
   - `use-files-to-save-your-personal-assistant-data`
   - `convert-file-types`

7. **External Libraries & APIs**
   - `build-a-language-translator`
   - `using-modules-to-shift-time`
   - `get-creative-with-the-turtle-module`

8. **Error Handling**
   - `error-handling-with-try-and-except`

9. **Integration Projects**
   - `complete-your-personal-assistant`
   - `build-a-birthday-reminder-app`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **Standard Library Modules** - datetime, random, turtle, file I/O
- **External APIs** - Translation services
